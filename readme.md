### Journey Through Inferno ### 

Dante and Virgil take to the offensive in this Top down 2D Dungeon-Crawler, instead of the fanfiction stroll through Hell, our heroes pick up sword and spells to fight their way through Hades, gaining impressive abilities through the power of tarot cards!

Upon killing an enemy, the player may pick up a Tarot card, which at the end of a level allows the player to choose from a random selection of power-ups. These can affect player movement, damage, health and more.
